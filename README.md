# Internet-Speed-Test

The internet connection in our homes and offices can differ by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), allowable traffic limit, and most importantly network speed. So what do you usually do when you want to test the speed of your connection? You google it, right? How about testing it using Python from your machine!!

Speedtest cli library provides Command Line Interface (CLI) for testing internet bandwidth using speedtest.net.
If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [Speedtest Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/speedtest-cli/).
